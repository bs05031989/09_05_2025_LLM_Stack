🔍 What’s the Best LLM Stack in 2025? Let’s Break It Down.

The landscape is evolving fast—every other week, there’s a new tool, platform, or workflow promising to be the answer. But amidst the noise, a more important question remains:

👉 What’s your LLM stack?
Are you going fully local? All-in on the cloud? Or crafting your own hybrid solution?

Here’s what we’re seeing in the wild:

🖥️ The Local-First Camp:
Folks prioritizing privacy, cost control, and full ownership are leaning into tools like Ollama, llama.cpp, and Open WebUI. It’s hands-on and GPU-hungry, but you own the stack—and your data stays with you.

☁️ Cloud Loyalists:
For many, convenience wins. With platforms like OpenAI, Anthropic, Deepseek, and Gemini, it’s about speed and scalability. Just buy credits, call the APIs, and focus on output. No hardware, no setup—just a (slightly growing) invoice.

🔀 Hybrid Tinkerers:
Then there’s the mix-and-match crowd. Coding? Use Cursor, Windsurf, or Copilot. Summarizing or browsing? Try Perplexity or Deepseek v3. It's less about one tool, more about building the right toolbox.

But at the heart of it, two things matter most in 2025: Privacy and Flexibility.
We want powerful tools—but we don’t want to compromise on data or get locked into rigid workflows.

💬 So, I’m curious:

Are local models the way forward, or will the cloud continue to dominate?

Do we need so many tools, or are we just making things harder for ourselves?
